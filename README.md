Should you use Termdocs or Terminal Docs:
    Terminal Docs offers a file explorer and is recommended for casual users or as a no install needed text editor/viewer for Mac and Windows when away from personal computer.
 
	Termdocs offers a command line only version that is far more convenient if you are comfortable working strictly within a Shell. Store in C:\System32\ for Windows /usr/bin/ for Mac and Linux.
 
	Terminal Docs Has all of the features of Termdocs except  for Mac users. Due to the structure of the “.app”. 

About Terminal Docs and Terminal Docs Lite:
    Terminal Docs is a line by line text-editor,text-reader,and general purpose workstation. It allows for active insertion, replacement, deletion, and running Terminal/Windows cmd/shell commands for compiling and testing while using. Terminal Docs was written using Python 2.7 and compiled for Mac with py2app, linux and Windows with pyinstaller. In order to pass terminal paths to the Mac version, download termdocs-Mac, extract and follow instructions to install. Termdocs was compiled for all platforms using pyinstaller.

	I suggest Writing first drafts with a comfortable text editor and then error check, clean, read, and edit using Terminal Docs or Terminal Docs Lite.
